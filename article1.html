<p>In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, roughly 970 million Indians were eligible to vote. Of these, 65.79% cast their ballots — lower than the 67.4% of 2019, the highest ever recorded. But the aggregate number conceals the real story: who voted, where, for what reason, and with what level of genuine ideological commitment.</p>

<p>After four years of field research across three state elections — Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan — my clearest conclusion is also the most uncomfortable one for political strategists: <strong>the models most parties are using to predict voter behaviour were designed for an electorate that no longer exists.</strong></p>

<hr class="br">

<h2><span class="sec">Finding I</span>The Welfare-Identity Split Is Now Structural, Not Seasonal</h2>

<p>The foundational assumption of Indian electoral analysis — that welfare delivery reinforces community loyalty — is fracturing. In Bihar's Seemanchal region, I conducted structured interviews across 8 assembly constituencies over 18 months, covering Muslim, OBC, and Yadav voter groups in Araria, Kishanganj, Katihar, and Purnia.</p>

<p>What emerged consistently was a cognitive separation that most political models don't account for: <strong>voters were simultaneously grateful for scheme delivery and determined to vote for an alternative party.</strong> A family that had benefited from Nitish Kumar's Saat Nishchay programme — electricity connections, paved roads, toilet construction — spoke of the delivery positively while making clear their vote would go elsewhere, based on representation concerns, fear of community isolation, or a specific local grievance.</p>

<div class="pq"><p>"Irrespective of who I vote for, no government will now be able to stop the scheme. So I vote for who I really want." — beneficiary of welfare scheme, Seemanchal, 2023</p></div>

<p>This sentiment is not anecdotal. The Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections showed a notable shift: <strong>landed farming communities — non-Savarna, non-OBC — had shifted toward the INDIA alliance despite being welfare recipients under the NDA</strong>, citing rural distress and the farmers' agitation as the decisive factor. Jats in Rajasthan, Yadavs in UP, Marathas in Maharashtra, Vokkaligas and Lingayats in Karnataka all demonstrated partial welfare-vote decoupling.</p>

<span class="cite">Source: Lokniti-CSDS, "The Sociology of 2024 Lok Sabha Elections in 10 Charts," ThePrint, March 2025; author's field research, Bihar, 2022–2023</span>

<p>The political implication is significant. A government that delivers schemes cannot assume loyalty. It must also manage representation, grievance, and local power dynamics. <strong>The voter is now disaggregating two previously merged identities: beneficiary identity and voter identity.</strong></p>

<h2><span class="sec">Finding II</span>The First-Time Voter: Most Volatile, Least Served by Existing Models</h2>

<p>India added approximately 21 million new voters between 2019 and 2024, the youngest among them turning 18 during the post-pandemic period — a formative political environment of economic disruption and social media saturation.</p>

<p>The Lokniti-CSDS pre-poll survey of 2024, conducted across 10,019 individuals in 19 states, found that <strong>62% of respondents believed securing employment had become more difficult</strong> — 65% among men, 59% among women. Among youth specifically, the International Labour Organisation's 2023 report found that over 80% of India's unemployed workforce is youth, with graduate-level youth unemployment having increased from 35.2% in 2000 to 65.7% by 2022.</p>

<div class="data-row">
  <div class="data-cell"><span class="dn">62%</span><div class="dl">Of all voters believe finding employment has become harder (CSDS pre-poll, 2024)</div></div>
  <div class="data-cell"><span class="dn">80%</span><div class="dl">Of India's unemployed workforce comprises youth (ILO, 2023)</div></div>
  <div class="data-cell"><span class="dn">65.7%</span><div class="dl">Of unemployed youth have secondary education or higher — up from 35.2% in 2000 (ILO)</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the 2024 AP elections, I led demographic outreach in Bobili constituency, Vizianagaram. The contrast between how first-time voters (18–22) and older cohorts processed the election was striking. Older voters had established caste-aligned defaults and were primarily responsive to community leaders. First-time voters — particularly young men with some secondary education — were voting on a different axis: whether they believed the winning candidate could plausibly affect their employment situation within the next five years.</p>

<p><strong>They are also structurally harder to reach.</strong> Traditional booth-agent networks are built on relationships cultivated over election cycles. A 20-year-old has no history with these networks. He is not at the party meeting on Sunday. He is watching political commentary on YouTube at 11pm. Parties that haven't invested in this channel have a growing blind spot.</p>

<h2><span class="sec">Finding III</span>Women's Turnout: The Numbers Are Real, the Interpretation Is Often Wrong</h2>

<p>For the first time on record, women voted at higher rates than men in the 2019 general election. In 2024, the gender gap in voter turnout continued to narrow — 946 female electors per 1,000 male electors in 2024, up from 926 in 2019 per Election Commission data. But this national aggregate obscures enormous variation in <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> women are voting.</p>

<p>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace research identifies at least two competing hypotheses for the turnout increase: the <strong>self-empowerment hypothesis</strong> — rising literacy and media exposure driving political agency — and the <strong>welfare mobilisation hypothesis</strong> — women's SHGs, scheme beneficiary networks, and party-aligned women's groups systematically driving turnout.</p>

<p>In my field research across Khajuwala and Nokha in Rajasthan's Bikaner division, the reality was layered. Women from landed farming households were voting on water access and MSP. Urban SHG members were voting on credit access and livelihood schemes. Young women in rural areas were voting on safety, mobility, and the presence of a daughter on the party ticket. Women over 50 were voting on continuity and community alignment.</p>

<div class="pq"><p>The "women's vote" is not a bloc. It is four or five different electorates sharing a demographic category. Campaigns that target "women voters" as a single group with a single welfare scheme are leaving most of that potential on the table.</p></div>

<span class="cite">Sources: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "What Lies Behind India's Rising Female Voter Turnout," April 2024; Election Commission of India, Statistical Reports, Lok Sabha 2024; author's field research, Rajasthan, 2023</span>

<h2><span class="sec">Finding IV</span>Caste Arithmetic Is the Starting Point, Not the Answer</h2>

<p>The Lokniti-CSDS analysis of the 2024 Lok Sabha data makes a finding that campaign managers often resist: <strong>there was no major shift in voting preferences of major social groups at the national level.</strong> BJP retained its core coalition — upper caste, middle-class Hindu, EBC — while losing a "small but critical shift" among Dalits, poor rural communities, and Muslims in specific states.</p>

<p>What this tells practitioners is that caste arithmetic sets the ceiling of potential vote share for a party in any constituency. But the actual realised vote is determined by dozens of sub-constituency factors: which sub-caste holds the local power broker position, whether a community member was given or denied a party ticket in the previous cycle, which religious committee had a leadership dispute that mapped onto political allegiance, and whether a specific grievance — a land case, a ration card denial, a contractor dispute — activated a community's dormant anger.</p>

<p>In Seemanchal, this sub-constituency variation was so pronounced that within a single caste community across adjacent booths, I documented 3–4 distinct voting patterns. <strong>Caste tells you the approximate direction of the current. Booth-level intelligence tells you how fast it's moving and whether it's changed course.</strong></p>

<span class="cite">Sources: ThePrint / Lokniti-CSDS, "Sociology of 2024 Lok Sabha Elections," March 2025; author's field research, Bihar's Seemanchal region, 2022–2023</span>

<h2><span class="sec">Finding V</span>The Hybrid Intelligence Model: Neither AI Alone Nor Field Alone</h2>

<p>The most effective analytical approach I've developed combines two things that political strategy shops treat as alternatives: AI-assisted desk research and structured primary fieldwork.</p>

<p>AI tools — I use Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT regularly — are genuinely powerful for compressing days of desk research. Census data, 15-year electoral history across 243 constituencies, budget document analysis, media sentiment tracking: these tasks, which once consumed weeks, now take hours. Lokniti-CSDS archives, ECI statistical reports, and academic journals are all accessible and synthesisable at speed.</p>

<p>But no language model can tell you that the dominant narrative in Kishanganj shifted three weeks ago because a local religious figure made a statement that went viral in community WhatsApp groups. It cannot tell you that a family which has voted JD(U) for 20 years has gone quiet this cycle. It cannot hear what isn't being said. <strong>The booth agent hears what isn't being said.</strong></p>

<hr class="br">

<p>The parties that outperform in the next cycle will be those that have invested in both simultaneously — data systems that synthesise the macro, and field intelligence systems that capture the micro. The parties running 2019 playbooks on 2025 electorates will keep being surprised by results that their models failed to anticipate.</p>
